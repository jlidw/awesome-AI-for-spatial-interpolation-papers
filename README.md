# AI for Spatial Interpolation Papers

## Definition
**Spatial Interpolation** is the traditional method for spatial estimation, which is a process of using values at observed locations to estimate values at unobserved ones in geographic space.

**Spatiotemporal Interpolation** is an extension of spatial interpolation, which adds a time dimension to spatial data and estimate values at unobserved locations given the observations from sampled locations **during a period**.
